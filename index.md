# BIO3092 RNA-Seq Workshop

In this workshop we will introduce the key concepts and approaches for anlysing RNA-Seq data. For this workshop we will be looking at *Cryptococcus gattii*, a fungal pathogen of humans that can cause a disease called cryptococcosis. Through a series of lessons you will gain hands-on experience of using common RNA-Seq analysis tools to align reads to a reference, identify differentially expressed genes and perform pathway enrichment analysis. At each stage you will learn about common bioinformatics file formats, software packages for the analysis of biological data and inference of the results.
