## Setup

This workshop has been completed in R using an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. The markdown language allows you to easily format text, include code snippets and display images. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code, which includes any charts or tables created. Finally, notebooks produce a HTML document that can be viewed in any browser. There is a very handy [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) available from RStudio.
